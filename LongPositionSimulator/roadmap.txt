route planner
    in 5 seconds, perform this maneuver
        snaps to current path
        choose thrust dir
        choose thrust strength
        adjusted course is displayed

player can select own ships and give orders
    fly there
    use this velocity
    keep distnace to target
    attack target

nice to have:
    plot route foreach max(width, height) screen
        for each y, solve y = route(t), draw point at correspodning x
        => might need to rotate positionable to fit screen local space (if its rotated)
        => perfect curve, with no approximations or hard turns


SpaceObject
    - initial positionable
    - timedManeuvers
    - method: objectAt(time) -> returns object true position based on maneuvers
    - objectAtWithCurrentCourse(time)
        -returns assumed position in x seconds, using current Course, not knowing future course changes
    - collission testing
        - using assumed position
        - using true position
    how to hanlde
        - ship wants to perform x maneuvers
        - during maneuvers, ship gets hit/destoryed
        - can not fully perform maneuvers
        - actual movment is different from wanted (bc of collissions)

    ship has
        - currentCourse (positionable at this position, extrapolated to future)
            - displax To Enemy User
        - idealCourse (ship's desired path based on its maneuvers)
            - display to friendly user
        - true course (ship maneuver + outside forces, like being hit and pushed off course by a collission)
            - dont display to user, only for physx
