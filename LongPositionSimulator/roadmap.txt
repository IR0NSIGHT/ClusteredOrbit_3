route planner
    in 5 seconds, perform this maneuver
        snaps to current path
        choose thrust dir
        choose thrust strength
        adjusted course is displayed

player can select own ships and give orders
    fly there
    use this velocity
    keep distnace to target
    attack target

nice to have:
    plot route foreach max(width, height) screen
        for each y, solve y = route(t), draw point at correspodning x
        => might need to rotate positionable to fit screen local space (if its rotated)
        => perfect curve, with no approximations or hard turns
